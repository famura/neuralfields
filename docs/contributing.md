# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome and can be done is multiple ways, e.g. pull requests, bug reports, code review, or
feedback of any kind.
Speak freely but respectful.

Please do my OCD a favor and follow this naming convention for branches: `<classifier>/<description_with_underscores>`,
e.g. `fix/missing_import`, or `feat/cuda_support`, and this convention for commit messages:
`<Start with capital letter and not dot at the end>`, e.g. `Added new feature` or `Fixed typo`.
